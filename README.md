## Project 2: Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning


### Project Overview

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to segment customers based on their demographic and transactional data. The goal is to increase sales and optimize marketing efforts.


### Dataset

Mall Customers dataset
Variables: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)


### Machine Learning Algorithm

K-Means Clustering


### Libraries Used


* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn


### Project Structure


1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Visualization
3. K-Means Clustering
4. Elbow Method for Optimal K
5. Customer Segmentation


### Insights and Findings


* Gender distribution: Male-Female ratio
* Age distribution: Frequent age groups
* Spending scores: Majority of customers spend between 41-60
* Annual income: Majority of customers earn between 61-90k$


### Customer Segmentation


* 5 clusters identified using K-Means algorithm
* Clusters represent distinct customer segments based on spending scores and annual income
